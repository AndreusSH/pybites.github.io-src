Summary: Hi Pythonistas, it’s time to do things differently! Test-Driven Development has to be one of the hardest programming methodologies to adopt yet also one of the most satisfying. It forces a different mindset which is definitely not for everyone. Either way, put your thinking caps on and jump in!

Hi Pythonistas, it’s time to do things differently! Test Driven Development has to be one of the hardest programming methodologies to adopt yet also one of the most satisfying. It forces a different mindset which is definitely not for everyone. Either way, put your thinking caps on and jump in!

## What is Test-Driven Development?

An excerpt from this cool [TDD tutorial on Tuts+](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/beginning-test-driven-development-in-python--net-30137) sums it up nicely:

>TDD, in its most basic terms, is the process of implementing code by writing your tests first, seeing them fail, then writing the code to make the tests pass. You can then build upon this developed code by appropriately altering your test to expect the outcome of additional functionality, then writing the code to make it pass again.

## The Challenge

>Note: Use Google Translate to translate the below Spanish links into English if you need to.

The challenge is to use TDD of course but to make what? Rather than leave this open ended, we’re going to ask you to use TDD while solving a problem demo’d in the [PyConEs 2016 Introduction to TDD Workshop](https://github.com/aleasoluciones/pycones2016)!

[FizzBuzz](http://www.solveet.com/exercises/Kata-FizzBuzz/11) is a simple problem wherein your program will print the numbers from 1 to 100. The tricky part is that if a number being printed is divisible by 3, the program returns “Fizz” instead of the number.

Likewise, print “Buzz” for any number divisible by 5 and “FizzBuzz” for any number divisible by 3 and 5.

It’s a simple problem to solve with code which is why it’s an **excellent** use case for TDD!

Code a solution to the FizzBuzz problem using TDD and the challenge is complete. Make sure to PR your solution *and* your test file.

## Doing it for Yourself

We’re aware that you can simply submit a PR with a test file you’ve created *after* writing your script but clearly that defeats the purpose of this challenge!

This challenge is intended to get you to try using TDD. There are no winners or losers so there really would be no point in writing the tests after! For that, feel free to try [Code Challenge 39](https://pybit.es/codechallenge39.html)!
