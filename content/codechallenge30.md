Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding. Wow challenge 30 already! This week we let you hone your refactoring skills. Learn, code, PR submit (don't be shy) and above all have fun!

##Â The challenge

The challenge is pretty simple:

* Go through you code and identify something you think can be improved.

* Write some tests to verify it does the right thing. This could be pytest, unittest or [just a simple assert](https://github.com/pybites/blog_code/commit/ce498d71e0316b2ecf7c4c9884fb988ba3a32c5d), just have a safeguard in place before starting to touch the code. Version control is your other friend here.

* `for cycle in refactorings`:

	* Refactor it 
	
	* Verify all works with your tests

* Submit a PR for our review - this week we will be extra picky on PEP8 compliance! ;)

## Getting ready

See [our INSTALL doc](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) how to fork [our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) to get cracking.

This doc also provides you with instructions how you can submit your code to our community branch via a Pull Request (PR). We will feature your PRs in our end-of-the-week challenge review ([previous editions](http://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html)).

## Feedback

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues) or [reach out](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) directly.

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
