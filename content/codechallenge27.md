Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! Love or hate Reddit, it has a lot of good data to work with. This week we have you write an app of your choice using the Reddit API. Have fun!

## The challenge

First of all thanks [shibasisp](https://github.com/shibasisp) for raising [the issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues/42). We like the 2 examples you provided so we post them here: 

* A program that would fetch one challenge from easy, one from Intermediate and one hard from r/dailyprogrammer and shows it in the console. (PyBites: definitely something we could use!)

* A program that would fetch 10 (or so) news items from r/news and sort them in decreasing order of upvotes.

### More ideas

* Fetch a user's history, [example](http://alan-wright.com/programming/tutorial/python/2014/03/09/praw-tutorial/).

* Build a Reddit Bot, [example](http://pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/).

* Do some data analysis, for example: build word clouds, [example](http://www.randalolson.com/2013/03/01/fun-with-the-python-reddit-api-wrapper-and-word-clouds/).

* You could even do a bit of sentiment analysis of a comment thread using something like [textblob](https://pybit.es/codechallenge07_review.html) or [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org).

But these are just examples. Feel free to build anything. The goal is to sharpen your coding skills. If you scratch your own itch even better (last week's [Pomodori Tracker](https://pybit.es/codechallenge26_review.html) for example is something we use on a daily basis now).

### Further resources 

* [PRAW docs](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - probably your number one goto. The easiest way to get PRAW running is to [create a virtual env](https://pybit.es/the-beauty-of-virtualenv.html) and do a `pip install praw` and follow the docs.

* [Reddit API resources page](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API) - OAuth for authentication / check out API limits / links to other wrapper modules.

### Please share

While you're at it, if you like this challenge upvote it [on Reddit]() or retweet it on [Twitter](). The more people coding with us == more possible PR submissions to feature in our end-of-the-week review == the more we all learn from this!

## Getting ready

See [our INSTALL doc](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) how to fork [our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) to get cracking.

This doc also provides you with instructions how you can submit your code to our community branch via a Pull Request (PR). We will feature your PRs in our end-of-the-week challenge review ([previous editions](http://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html)).

## Feedback

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, please [contact us](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) or open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues).

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
