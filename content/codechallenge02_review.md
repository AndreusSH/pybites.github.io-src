It's Friday again so we review the [code challenge of this week](http://pybit.es/codechallenge02.html). It's never late to join, just fork our [challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) and start coding.

## A possible solution

See [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/solutions/02/game.py) for the complete solution.

Some learnings:

* First we had the user interface like this: 

		def input_word(draw):
			while True:
				word = input('Form a valid word: ').upper()
				if not set(word) < set(draw):
					print('One or more characters not in draw, try again')
					continue
				elif not word.lower() in DICTIONARY:
					print('Not a valid dictionary word, try again')
					continue
				return word

	But after learning about [EAFP (easier to ask for forgiveness than permission)](http://pybit.es/error_handling.html) we thought it was more Pythonic to use exceptions. There was also a bug in the first check above (see comments, great learning!)

		def input_word(draw):
			while True:
				word = input('Form a valid word: ').upper()
				try:
					return _validation(word, draw)
				except ValueError as e:
					print(e)
					continue

		def _validation(word, draw):
			# thanks Durmus
			for char in word.upper():
				if char in draw:
					draw.remove(char)
				else:
				raise ValueError("{} is not a valid word!".format(word))
			if not word.lower() in DICTIONARY:
				raise ValueError('Not a valid dictionary word, try again')
			return word

* random.sample makes it easy to get n number of random letters in one go: 

		def draw_letters():
			return random.sample(POUCH, NUM_LETTERS)

* get_possible_dict_words - the hardest part. To get all possible letter combinations from the letter draw, you need itertools.permutations, not combinations, because order does matter: 

		>>> len(list(itertools.combinations(letters, 2)))
		21
		>>> len(list(itertools.permutations(letters, 2)))
		42

	See also [our post on itertools](http://pybit.es/itertools-examples.html). See also Durmus' comment / solution here for an alternative using combinations ...

* First the helper generator to do the work:

		def _get_permutations_draw(draw):
			for i in range(1, 8):
				yield from list(itertools.permutations(draw, i))  # >= 3.3

	This creates all permutation of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 letters.

	We store all those in permutations and then use a set operation again to get all valid dictionary words:

		def get_possible_dict_words(draw):
			permutations = [''.join(word).lower() for word in _get_permutations_draw(draw)]
			return set(permutations) & set(DICTIONARY)

We use the calc_word_value and max_word_value methods from [challenge 01](http://pybit.es/codechallenge01.html) to calculate which word has the most value. 

The rest is main() calling the methods and outputting (as was provided in the template).

## Tests

We got a request in the comments for tests to verify the work. Good idea, they are [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/02/test_game.py).

	$ python test_game.py 
	......

	Ran 6 tests in 0.056s

	OK

##Â Its fun (addictive?) to play :)

## next(challenges)

Monday we will be back with a new challenge, stay tuned ...

Again to start coding [fork our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) or [sync it](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) if you already forked it.
