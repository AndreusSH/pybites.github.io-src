In this article we review last week's [Build Your Own Hacktoberfest Checker With Bottle](http://pybit.es/codechallenge38.html) code challenge. 

### Submissions

We had quite a few submissions, nice!

* [clamytoe](https://github.com/clamytoe): Martin wrote a simple script to check the status of your Hacktoberfest progress. Code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/38/clamytoe). He did it on his iphone using [Pythonista](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097?mt=8), cool!

* [kiniadit](https://github.com/kiniadit) made `hkfst.py` with features: anonymous API access, opens localhost, checks PRs for a single username and returns Hacktoberfest progress. Code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/38/kiniadit).

* [pweids](https://github.com/pweids): This is really hacked together. It's as simple as possible to complete the challenge. No glitz, glam, or stability. Code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/38/pweids).

* [bbelderbos](https://github.com/bbelderbos): Good workout using Bottle, Github API. TODO: write some pytests (mocking the API). Code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/38/bbelderbos).

We hope you persisted through #Hacktoberfest so you get your DigitalOcean's free T-shirt. If you do, send us a selfie :)
