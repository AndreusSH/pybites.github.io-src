In this article we review last week's [Image Manipulation With Pillow](http://pybit.es/codechallenge31.html) code challenge. Some nice submissions to share ...

### Submissions

Submissions are merged to our [Community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community) -> [Challenge 31 subdir](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/31):

* [bbelderbos](https://github.com/bbelderbos) created *PyBites Banner Generator* to create quick but nice banners for PyBites pillars Articles / Challenges / News / Special:
	
	> Using Gimp to make banners manually is cumbersome to say the least. Why not semi-automate it? Now it takes seconds to make a PyBites banner and I got enough material out of it to write two articles on Pillow and Flask. You can checkout the first one [here](https://pybit.es/pillow-banner-image.html), the second one will come out somewhere this week ...
	
	See the [README](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/community/31/bbelderbos/README.md) for full details and examples.

* [clamytoe](https://github.com/clamytoe) created *Thumbler* - a proof of concept script that extracts faces as thumbnails from an image:

	> I started out wanting to use some sort of machine learning to detect faces in images, but I got sick and had to settle for a quick OpenCV implementation. At first I was going to try and group the extracted faces into their own folder, but since I ran out of time, I just grouped them by image.

	Awesome work. See the [README](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/community/31/clamytoe/README.md) for full details and examples.
