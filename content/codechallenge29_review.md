In this article we review last week's [Create a Simple Django App](http://pybit.es/codechallenge29.html) code challenge. The Django fever continues ...

### Submissions

Submissions are merged to [this dir](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/29) on our [community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community).

* [bbelderbos](https://github.com/bbelderbos) created *Django Registration App* - from the PR:

	> I created a Django registration / login system using django-registration and gmail. I used purecss and django-crispy-forms for styling. I deployed it [to Heroku](http://pybites-notifier.herokuapp.com/). What's cool about it is that I can re-use this code for other new projects where this functionality is often required. I will do an article this week detailing some of the challenges I had to get this working ...

	So you can now be notified by email of each new challenge [here](http://pybites-notifier.herokuapp.com/). Note this is just the subscription management part, the notifier we built for [Praw code challenge 27](https://pybit.es/codechallenge27_review.html).

* No other submissions yet. As there is no deadline to these challenges, we will update here when you submit any other cool Django apps for this challenge ... Just follow [our instructions](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and start coding!

### Next Challenge

A couple of weeks ago Julian wrote [a nice article on refactoring](https://pybit.es/refactoring.html). 

Refactoring is an essential skill in the developer's toolbox. Stay tuned for our new challenge tomorrow where we have you go find ugly/dark/wtf parts of your code to turn it into beautiful Python. See you tomorrow!
