In this article we review last week's [Improve Your Python Code With BetterCodeHub](http://pybit.es/codechallenge35.html) code challenge. 

### Submissions

Submissions are merged to our [Community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community) -> [Challenge 35 subdir](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/35):

* [hobojoe1848](https://github.com/hobojoe1848) submitted his [Generic Emailer Script](https://github.com/hobojoe1848/generic-emailer):
	
This is a simple script I wrote to automate sending emails from my Gmail account. It’s generic such that I use it in various different programs. When I had BCH analyse the repo I received a score of 7, meaning it failed 3 points. The most obvious to me was the “Write Short Units of Code” test:

![Better Code Hub Score of 7]({filename}/images/emailer-bch-7.png)

The original script that resulted in this score is [here](https://github.com/hobojoe1848/generic-emailer/blob/master/generic_emailer.old)

Tackling this issue had me refactor the entire script after which, BCH gave me a pass and my score jumped to 8:

![Better Code Hub Score of 8]({filename}/images/emailer-bch-8.png)

What a great tool! I’m a big fan of BCH after this!!
