It's end of the week again so we review the [code challenge of this week](http://pybit.es/codechallenge09.html). It's never late to join, just fork our [challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) and start coding.

## Learning

###Â Julian

Admittedly, when Bob and I discussed this challenge, I was a little intimidated. I'd never actually dealt with any of these concepts before! That said, I'm so glad we put this one out there!

If it wasn't for the challenge, I wouldn't have learned nearly as much as I did.

Given my current job role, I decided that it'd be fun to try and wrap a context manager around SSH functionality. This was a perfect choice given you need to specifically call .close() to close off the SSH session. If not, it just stays open indefinitely (or until timeout).

All up, I had to solidify my understanding of generators, context managers and ssh within Python.
In a venv, I installed the [paramiko SSH package](http://www.paramiko.org/) and went from there.

After figuring out how to get the SSH connection going, I then spent the time bundling it all up within the context manager. [Dan Bader's post](https://dbader.org/blog/python-context-managers-and-with-statement); the [pep-0343 doc](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/) and a few Googled questions on Stack Overflow helped sort me out.

See the full code [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/solutions/09/with_ssh.py). Not only does it work, but I'm also now using at home with my NAS!

### Bob

This was a nice challenge. I got inspired by the DB rollback example of [PEP 343](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/). I wanted to see if I could use some existing code. 

That's why I did some refactoring on my [Simple Flask API](http://pybit.es/simple-flask-api.html) test code. Just as an exercise, in real life I actually like the setUp/tearDown sandwich unittest already provides. 

What I really liked was that I got to think about different ways to implement this: [class](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/solutions/09/with_testdb_class.py) vs [contextmanager](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/solutions/09/with_testdb.py). All this experimentation led to some good learning, Julian experienced the same working on his solution.

And I got to use pytest :)

	(venv) [bbelderb@macbook 09 (solutions)]$ pytest with_tes*
	=== test session starts ===
	...

	with_testdb.py ..
	with_testdb_class.py ..

	=== 4 passed in 0.01 seconds ===
