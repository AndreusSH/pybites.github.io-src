In this article we review last week's [Build a Django Tracker, Weather or Review App](http://pybit.es/codechallenge33.html) code challenge. 

### Submissions

Submissions are merged to our [Community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community) -> [Challenge 33 subdir](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/33):

* [bbelderbos](https://github.com/bbelderbos) submitted [pbreadinglist](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/33/bbelderbos):
	
	> I started porting [fbreadinglist](http://fbreadinglist.com/) PHP/MySQL app to Python/Django/Heroku/Postgres. I migrated the autocomplete, added [bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) (responsive design) and used [Simpleisbetterthancomplex' nice starter code](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/10/24/how-to-add-social-login-to-django.html) to add social login. Now I need to add user's book queues/reviews. App so far is on Heroku: [pbreadinglist.herokuapp.com](https://pbreadinglist.herokuapp.com/)

* If you did some Django work for this challenge PR it and we'll include it here.
