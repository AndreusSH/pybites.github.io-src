Hi Pythonistas, it’s so easy to forget that we were all once new to Python. One of the major hurdles on the Python journey is learning and mastering data structures, specifically dicts and lists. This challenge takes you back to basics!

## Why Dicts and Lists?

Dictionaries have to be one of the harder data structures to learn when starting out with Python *(or was that just me? - Julian)*. If you don’t use them daily/continuously then it’s quite easy to forget how to interact with them. The same goes for lists.

We decided to host this challenge to give Pythonistas that may be starting from scratch something to sink their teeth into. With that said, the experienced among you may enjoy finding the simplest way to solve the problems! Carry on.

## The Challenge

The challenge is to use a dict we’ve created ([here](<URL>)) to meet the following criteria. It’s almost like a series of exercises created to flex that brain muscle!

Preferably solve each requirement using a different function, just for the readability, then PR the file.

1. Print our every model of Jeep.
2. Print out all of the manufacturers along with their vehicle models.
3. Print all vehicles that contain the string “Trail” in their names.
4. Print the first car of every manufacturer.
5. Sort the dict alphabetically. (Not just print, but actually sort the data).
6. Reverse the order of the model lists within the dict.

All output should be human readable, not containing the list/dict braces.

We know it’s simple but it’s exercises like this that keep you on your toes and get you thinking. Plus, it’s fun to just manipulate data sometimes!
