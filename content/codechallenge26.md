Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! Web apps tend to get all the love so it’s about time we shared the spotlight with GUIs. This week let’s take our first dive as a PyBites Community into Python GUIs!


## The challenge

We’re keeping this simple as this will be the first foray into GUIs for a lot of you (us included). All we’re asking you to do is create a simple GUI. Done!

You can use whatever framework or toolkit that floats your boat, just be creative and come up with a plain old GUI screen.

You could use an image as a backdrop with some overlays or even create your own type of Game “Main Menu” screen. The choice is yours.


##Bonus

We imagine that this may be a bit too simple for some of you, or may just be quicker to achieve than you thought. If that’s the case, why not add some functionality to the GUI? Consider this a bonus objective - not mandatory in the least.

For example, with the Game Main Menu screen, you could make a “Credits” button that then links to another screen which scrolls through fictional names.

Create a stopwatch GUI that actually has timing functionality. How about a calculator?

Whatever you decide, create a working GUI with added functionality and earn extra kudos.


## A few resources

* The two main toolkits that come to mind are [TkInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) and [PyGame](http://pygame.org/).

* Check out this comprehensive [list of Frameworks/Toolkits](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming) to get started.



## Getting ready

See [our INSTALL doc](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) how to fork [our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) to get cracking.

This doc also provides you with instructions how you can submit your code to our community branch via a Pull Request (PR). We will feature your PRs in our end-of-the-week challenge review ([previous editions](http://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html)).

## Feedback

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, please [contact us](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) or open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues).

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
