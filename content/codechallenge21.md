Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! This week we will get you to create a simple app to calculate the monetary cost of using an electrical device. Enjoy!

##The Challenge

The challenge is simple. We want you to create an app that will allow you to calculate the hourly cost of running an electrical device.

**Basic Requirements:**

* App will allow a user to enter the wattage consumption of a device (eg, a 20w light globe) and a cost per kilowatt hour (kWh). kWh being the unit of measurement the electric company charges by.

* The app will then return the cost of running the device for 1 hour.

> This is the absolute baseline for beginners. We recommend you continue with the Bonus Features.


**Bonus Features:**

To make it interesting, see if you can complete the following:

* Make this a web app using the framework of your choice. It’d look great in a browser!

* Allow a user to enter in how many hours they want to use the device for and have this factored into your cost result (eg, Using a 20w globe at 50 cents per kWh for 10 hours).

* Use persistent storage (sqlite, shelf, etc) to store all queries to the app and have the ability to print this stored data back to the user when requested.

* If you don’t want to make it a web app, see if you can construct a GUI using [TkInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) or other.

Consider this a half specific, half open ended challenge. There’s an intentional, specific goal here but how you get there is up to you. If you’re a newbie and it takes time, feel free to leave this as a CLI based app.

It doesn’t matter how great it looks, only that you were challenged along the way and learned something!

## Getting ready

See [our INSTALL doc](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) how to fork [our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) to get cracking. 

This doc also provides you with instructions how you can submit your code to our community branch via a Pull Request (PR). We will feature your PRs in our end-of-the-week challenge review ([previous editions](http://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html)).

## Feedback

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, please [contact us](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) or open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues).

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
