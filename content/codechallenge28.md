Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! We are delighted to have Michael Herman ([Real Python](https://realpython.com)) deliver this week's challenge. Prepare to learn some useful new skills and above all have fun!

Enter Michael.

##Â The challenge

Create a Flask app that displays a basic data visualization with [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org). 

If you're feeling up to it, deploy the app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) as well.

Need some data to work with?

* [Simple Twitter Archive Digest](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/086)
* [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)
* [Data.gov - Datasets](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=CSV)

But you can use any data set. The goal is to use Bokeh inside Flask.

### Suggested workflow

This challenge includes a number of moving pieces, so make sure to break it down into smaller steps. 

For example:

1. Create a basic Flask app
2. Manually test the app locally
3. Create a data visualization with Bokeh
4. Integrate the Bokeh chart with the Flask app
5. Manually test the app again locally

If you want more practice, burn it all down and start over again. Continue doing this until you feel comfortable with the workflow.

### Bonus

Share your awesome visualization with the world:

1. Set up Heroku and deploy
2. Manually test the app on Heroku
