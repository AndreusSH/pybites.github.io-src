In this article we review last week's [The Art of Refactoring: Improve Your Code](http://pybit.es/codechallenge30.html) code challenge. We're excited to have done 30 challenges so far and it feels like we only got started. Prepare for more to come!

### Submissions

Submissions are merged to [this dir](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/30) on our [community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community).

* [bbelderbos](https://github.com/bbelderbos) refactored PyBites' Slack Karma Bot:
	
	> This was a great challenge for me to A. put unittest mocking into practice, refactoring code for a Slack bot and B. try out SIG's [BetterCodeHub](https://bettercodehub.com/) to lead my refactorings. This worked out pretty well. See the readme for more details. I will do a follow-up article as well.
	
	See the [README](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/community/30/bbelderbos/README.md) for full details.

* [hobojoe1848](https://github.com/hobojoe1848) refactored his very first script:

	> The very first script I wrote! A "Troubleshooting Wheel of Fortune" to print out random troubleshooting steps to help myself and my team (jokingly) troubleshoot hardware faults. Terribly lame but a trip down memory lane!

	See the [README](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/community/30/hobojoe1848/README.md) for full details.

* [mjhea0](https://github.com/mjhea0) refactored a Flask route handler:

	> For this challenge I decided to refactor a Flask route handler because of this [issue](https://github.com/realpython/flask-jwt-auth/issues/9) that was added to the [Flask JWT Auth project](https://github.com/realpython/flask-jwt-auth). Since this project is the example app built for the [Token-Based Authentication With Flask](https://realpython.com/blog/python/token-based-authentication-with-flask/) blog post, I had to update the blog post as well.

	See the [README](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/community/30/mjhea0/README.md) for full details.

Keep Calm and Code in Python!
