This week was pretty busy due to PyCon, but what an amazing conference! A lot to absorb which we will digest in the upcoming articles. First our regular schedule though: review of [last week's challenge](http://pybit.es/codechallenge19.html): post to your favorite API. 

## PyCon

Before we dive in just to say we are absolutely stoked about the positive feedback we got engaging with fellow Pythonistas at PyCon this week! People got excited about the code challenges: the fact it stretches fellow programmers and the way they can submit their work via PR. So we definitely keep using this format for now. Do reach out though if you have any feedback or want to submit a code challenge / share your ideas, they are more than welcome. Thanks. 

## Our solutions

Here are some scripts that POST to APIs all taken from our [100 Days of Code repo](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode): 

* This week's contribution:

	* Facebook API: [a script to automatically post to our FB group](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode/blob/master/053/) which uses the [facebook-sdk package]() and [click]() which is neat to create command line interfaces.

* Previously featured:

	* Twitter API: [script to (daily) auto-tweet our 100 Days of Code progress](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode/blob/master/053/) ([article]()). If you are curious about Twitter bots, you might want to check out [our article]() and [this poster]() spotted at PyCon.

	* Slack API: [post to Slack upon each domain mention on Twitter](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode/blob/master/020/) ([article]()). We also have [an article]() on how to build a Slack bot.

* TODO

    * We initially wanted to look at the [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) or [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/) API but we lacked the time. We will update this article when we get around it. Or maybe it's a nice one for you to contribute?

## next(Challenges)

This week we will dive into Object Oriented Programming. We will set up a nice free-form challenge to let you experiment with classes, inheritance and more. Stay tuned ...

> Now is better than never.

We hope you are having fun with these challenges. Remember there is no deadline, you can PR your code anytime. Just remember to isolate (branch) your changes and submit against our Community branch (as per instructions).

Come code with us forking [our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges). Have fun!
