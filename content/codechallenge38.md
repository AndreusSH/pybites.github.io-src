Hi Pythonistas, Hacktoberfest started. Let's make open source better and track our progress with a little app you will build using the [Bottle web framework](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/).

## It's Hacktoberfest

DigitalOcean's [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) is a month-long celebration of open source software. You can earn a cool T-shirt making four pull requests to any public repo on GitHub between October 1â€“31. 

Potential projects you could contribute to are listed on their site but PRs you make for our code challenges count too!

## The Challenge

[Hacktoberfest Checker](https://hacktoberfestchecker.herokuapp.com) ([code](https://github.com/jenkoian/hacktoberfest-checker)) is a neat web app to see how close you are to achieving the requirements (4 PRs) for a free t-shirt. It is written [in JS](https://github.com/jenkoian/hacktoberfest-checker/blob/master/controllers/index.js).

We thought it would be a cool challenge to build this with Bottle (optionally adding the JS you'd like):

1. Make a virtual env and install Bottle.

2. Make a form to ask for the user. Optionally add GitHub login to retrieve the user automatically.

3. Retrieve the PRs via the GitHub API. You can borrow the required query [here](https://github.com/pybites/hacktoberfest-checker/blob/master/controllers/index.js) (L15). Yes, the date range seems odd but it accounts for various timezones. It was taken from DigitalOcean's 'official' checker (as explained [in this issue](https://github.com/jenkoian/hacktoberfest-checker/pull/104#issuecomment-333376597)).

4. Display the PR's and progress as (*n out of 4*). You can use the [these status messages](https://github.com/pybites/hacktoberfest-checker/blob/master/controllers/index.js) (L67).

5. (bonus) allow checking multiple GH handles so you could compare progress among fellow developers or friends.
