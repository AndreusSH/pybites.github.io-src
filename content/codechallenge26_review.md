In this article we review last week's [Create a Simple Python GUI](http://pybit.es/codechallenge26.html) code challenge. 

### Submissions

* [bbelderbos](https://github.com/bbelderbos) made a *Reading Progress Pomodori Tracker GUI* inspired by the article: [How to Read More](https://kimschlesinger.com/blog/read-more.html). It uses [easygui](http://pythonhosted.org/easygui/) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). For more info, see [the README](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/26/bbelderbos).

* [clamytoe](https://github.com/clamytoe) continued his [*pyTrack*](https://pybit.es/guest-pytrack-app.html) project wrapping a GUI around it using [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter). Nice addition, will make it more usable. See [the README](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/26/clamytoe) for more details.
