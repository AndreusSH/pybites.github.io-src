In this article we review last week's [Daily Python Tip Part 1 - Make a Web App](http://pybit.es/codechallenge40.html) code challenge. 

### Submissions

* [bbelderbos](https://github.com/bbelderbos) used Bottle again: 

	> This was a really cool project where I learned more about various modules. I also got to refactor it pretty well, adding pytests and scoring a 10 on BetterCodeHub. I would probably not have done it without raising the challenge. 

	The repo is [here](https://github.com/pybites/pytip) and the app is hosted [here](https://pytip.herokuapp.com/).

	Update 11th of Dec 2017: this app led to a guest post on Real Python - [check it out here](https://realpython.com/blog/python/building-a-simple-web-app-with-bottle-sqlalchemy-twitter-api/) for more details.

* [dseptem](https://github.com/dseptem) made a cool app using Apscheduler, Elasticsearch, Flask, and AngularJS! 

	> Easier than expected, but got kinda lazy on the AngularJS part =P. IMPORTANT: You need to have Elasticsearch running on localhost:9200 for this to work!

	The code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/40/dseptem).
