### Submissions

* [bbelderbos](https://github.com/bbelderbos): This was a really cool project where I learned more about various modules. I also got to refactor it pretty well, adding pytests and scoring a 10 on BetterCodeHub. I would probably not have done it without raising the challenge. The repo is [here](https://github.com/pybites/pytip) and the app is hosted [here](pytip.herokuapp.com).
