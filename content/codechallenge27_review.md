In this article we review last week's [PRAW: The Python Reddit API Wrapper](http://pybit.es/codechallenge27.html) code challenge. We had some really cool submissions so let's dive straight in:

### Submissions

* [hobojoe1848](https://github.com/hobojoe1848), being a Flask addict, created a simple Flask app (screenshot in repo). The app displays the "hottest" posts for some of his favourite subreddits. Code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/27/hobojoe1848).

* [bbelderbos](https://github.com/bbelderbos) created a script to autopost each new PyBites challenge to /r/learnpython. It already auto-posted [this week's new challenge](https://redd.it/6nzdd5). It also sends out a notification html email to a list of community members. Code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/27/bbelderbos).

* [shibasisp](https://github.com/shibasisp) created a script to pull the challenges listed on r/dailyprogrammer and sort them by difficulty (Easy, Medium and Hard). Just pip install it and you're on your way! Code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/27/shibasisp/).

* [asutosh97](https://github.com/asutosh97) created two scripts! The first returns the top ten news items on reddit and the second lists out challenges from r/dailyprogrammer, sorted by Easy, Medium or Hard. Code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/27/asutosh97).

### Next

This week we have Michael Herman ([Real Python](https://realpython.com)) delivering a nice challenge around Bokeh and Flask, check it out [here](https://pybit.es/codechallenge28.html).

By the way there is no deadline to these challenges, you can start any challenge at any time. We can always update our review posts with new PRs.

Follow [our instructions](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and start coding. Have fun!
