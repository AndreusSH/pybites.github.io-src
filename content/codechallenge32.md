Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python goodness. As [anticipated](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues/91) this week we dedicate a challenge to Selenium testing. We think this is a cool skill to add to your web dev + testing repertoire.

##Â The challenge

Our first intuition was to let you pull a Django app, but this might lead to config confusion. So let's test [our first Django app](https://pybit.es/learning-django.html). 

The [main page](pybites.pythonanywhere.com) is actually our [100DaysOfDjango home](https://pybit.es/tag/100daysofdjango.html) where we want to add more apps over time.

We ask you to help PyBites dev to deliver tests for this app using Selenium:

1. Go to the [pybites.pythonanywhere.com](http://pybites.pythonanywhere.com/). The header should say *PyBites 100 Days of Django*. The navbar has Login and Home links. The first link in the `main` div is *PyPlanet Article Sharer App*:

	![test the home page]({filename}/images/selenium-challenge1.png)

2. Click on the *PyPlanet Article Sharer App* link and test the page contains a `table` with a `th` (table header) containing the word *Title*. This app watches the PyPlanet feed so the titles change every day so that is hard test. What we can test though is if the table contains 100 entries (`tr`).

	![home page]({filename}/images/selenium-challenge2.png)

3. Go to an article and check there is only a *Go back* button (logged out view). Check if the header link at the top is the same as the link you clicked on, in this example: *Martin Fitzpatrick: KropBot: Multiplayer Internet-controlled robot*. The *Go back* should redirect back to [the app's home page](http://pybites.pythonanywhere.com/pyplanet/).

	![home page]({filename}/images/selenium-challenge3.png)

4. Using Selenium click *Login* and login with user: guest / password: changeme - then click the blue *Login* button:

	![home page]({filename}/images/selenium-challenge4.png)

5. Check you are redirected back to [100Days home](http://pybites.pythonanywhere.com/) and if navigation contains *Welcome back, guest!* and Logout and Home links:

	![home page]({filename}/images/selenium-challenge5.png)

6. Going back to the article link (3.), check that you now have a *Tweet this* button alongside the *Go back* button. Optionally you can check the link of the *Tweet this* button (extra check: PyBites entries have *New PyBites Article* prepended).

	![home page]({filename}/images/selenium-challenge6.png)

7. Finally logout with Selenium and check for *See you!* and *You have been successfully logged out.*, *logout* in the URL, and navbar links are Login and Home again:

	![home page]({filename}/images/selenium-challenge7.png)

By the way, if you don't like this app or want to test a Flask app (or other web framework), be our guest. Just mention it in your PR submission.

### Bonus

If you like to test even more you need superuser rights. As we use this app ourselves we only provide a guest login at this point. Nobody stops you though from [cloning the repo](https://github.com/pybites/pyplanet-django) and get it working locally. 

Apart from extra Django setup practice, doing so can can additionally test:

1. Create a Django superuser and use it to login to the app. Click the *Mark Skipped* button on an article and check if it marks the entry as orange back at the main app page/table view. Going back to the same article, the button is deactivated and the button text changed to *Already skipped*.

2. (still logged in) click the *Mark Shared* button on another article and check if it marks the entry green back at the main app page/table view. Going back to the same article, the button is deactivated and the button text changed to *Already shared*.

3. For both 1. and 2. the blue *Tweet this* button should have disappeared.

Again [here](https://pybit.es/learning-django.html) is how the app looks with superuser rights.
