Summary: Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! After last week's conceptual challenge ([generators](http://pybit.es/codechallenge11.html)), we'd like to challenge you this week to build [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). Every time we do games (previously [Word Values](http://pybit.es/codechallenge02.html) and [Hangman](http://pybit.es/codechallenge10.html)) we learn a lot. Enjoy and we review solutions end of this week.

Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! After last week's conceptual challenge ([generators](http://pybit.es/codechallenge11.html)), we'd like to challenge you this week to build [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). Every time we do games (previously [Word Values](http://pybit.es/codechallenge02.html) and [Hangman](http://pybit.es/codechallenge10.html)) we learn a lot. Enjoy and we review solutions end of this week.

### Details

Build a command line app where you can play against a friend or the computer. We recommend the latter to do some AI: to intelligently respond to player's moves (see [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy)). Maybe you can add game levels to avoid the machine to be 'too smart' (see [Google widget](https://www.google.es/search?q=tictactoe&oq=tictactoe) for example). 

For the best UX it's probably easiest to number the board like the keyboard's number pad: 7-8-9, 4-5-6, 1-2-3. We provided [a template](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/12/tictactoe-template.py) with some guidance, but maybe you want to start from scratch (let us know what works best for you ...)

### Getting ready 

See [our INSTALL doc](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) how to fork [our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) to get cracking. If you want to share your solution do [a PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/compare) and we will add it to [our community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community). We will feature creative solutions and learning in our review post.

### Archive

You can find all our code challenges so far [here](http://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html). If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, please [contact us](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) or open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues).

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
