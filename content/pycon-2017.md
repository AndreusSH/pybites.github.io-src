PyCon 2017 was such a great conference, I made so many good connections, got to see many good things the community is working on. It was very inspiring. 

In this article I will summarize some highlights and link to other resources.

## Networking

The best thing you can do at a conference.

In that context the best lesson I think came from [@AlSweigart](https://twitter.com/AlSweigart): 

> ... skip all the talks - conference is primarily about meeting new people. 

[All the talks are up](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJhliKNQ8g0qoE_zvL8eVg/videos) and you can watch them at your own pace, the in-person networking could only be done during these days though so I am happy I did plenty of that :)

Ideas, ideas, ideas. The expo hall was filled with companies and interesting people. I spoke with various companies and great software developers, I met with Dan Bader, Mike Kennedy, Brian Okken, Anthony Shaw, Trey Hunner, and many more, which gave me a lot of inspiration.

## Talks / workshops

* The keynotes were fantastic, from Kelsey Hightower's [Ok Google, talk to Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_iAXzy3xBA&feature=youtu.be&t=1677) to Jake's [Why is Python such an effective tool in science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyjCqQEUa8o):

> Why don't you use C instead of Python? It's so much faster

> Why don't you commute by plane instead of car? It's so much faster.

* Again [all the talks are on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJhliKNQ8g0qoE_zvL8eVg/videos) and they are packed with good info. Some that I attended and enjoyed: 

	* [Amjith Ramanujam - Awesome Command Line Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJhZhLg3obk): this was a great talk which taught me a lot of new tools to make your CLI apps more user-focused.
	* [Raymond Hettinger - Modern Python Dictionaries A confluence of a dozen great ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npw4s1QTmPg). As all talks by Raymond, highly informative and entertaining. More dicts: [Brandon Rhodes - The Dictionary Even Mightier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66P5FMkWoVU)
	* [Dave Forgac - Share Your Code! Python Packaging Without Complication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOH-h-EKKac) - useful / practical talk, makes me want to try [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and write an article about it.
	* [Sep Dehpour - Magic Method, on the wall, who, now, is the fairest one of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TfDYds8WPg) - this was a fun talk showing what you can do with dunder methods and some things you probably should not do ;)
	* [Chalmer Lowe - bokeh: Data Visualization in Python (workshop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xId9B1BVusA&t=11148s) - I will definitely use Bokeh next time I need to do some data visualization, this workshop gave me all the basics to get started.
	* [Ben Zaitlen, Matthew Rocklin, Min Ragan Kelley, Olivier Grisel - Parallel Data Analysis (workshop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIXACCJHtDg) - great experimentation/ (first) exposure to parallel tools like map, submit and Dask/Spark. The workshops showed a lot of new tools, here they used futures and snakeviz for example, very cool.
	* Testing: [Big picture software testing unit testing, Lean Startup, and everything in between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vaq_e7qUA-4) and [James Saryerwinnie - Next Level Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmsk1QZQEvQ): good overview and learning about new libraries to write more/better tests.
	* APIs: [Flávio Juvenal - How to make a good library API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mkFfce46zE) - nice talk showing examples of good vs bad APIs, conclusion: [an #API should make the simple easy, the complex possible and the wrong impossible](https://twitter.com/pybites/status/866053135399174145)
	* Data analysis: [Deborah Hanus - Lights, camera, action! Scraping a great dataset to predict Oscar winners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWtffImyfp8) - this was a cool example showing how to obtain and prepare movie data, perform data analysis and make predictions. It inspired me to try to do a similar analysis using another data set.

Some that I missed and plan on watching next: 

* [Andrew T Baker - 5 ways to deploy your Python web app in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGphzPLemZE)
* [Nicole Zuckerman - The Glory of pdb's set trace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FftatTS3jc)
* [Sam Agnew - Hacking Classic Nintendo Games with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v75rNdPukuI) 
* And definitely quite a few more ...

I did see a lot of Python 3.6 mentioned/used, which seems a good trend.

## Great community

One talk I wanted to highlight in particular is [Mariatta Wijaya's Dial M For Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc1krFb5ifQ) about finding a mentor and how she became the first Woman Python Core Dev. She received a [standing ovation](https://twitter.com/matrixise/status/865678978677223429) and it goes on to show how awesome our Python community is.

> Mentors learn from you too.

> ...

> Good mentor's don't hang around in communities that enable and accept trolls and assholes.
