In this article we review last week's [Integrate a Bokeh Chart Into Flask](http://pybit.es/codechallenge28.html) code challenge. We got some really nice submissions to share ...

* [bbelderbos](https://github.com/bbelderbos) made a word count plot of our blog. Using [Real Python's starter code](https://github.com/realpython/flask-bokeh-example/blob/master/tutorial.md) was very helpful. I do want to build something more interactive using [the movie data set provided for PCC13](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/master/13), also to practice deployment to Heroku. Bokeh is a really nice tool I definitely will use again for future visualization jobs Code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/28/bbelderbos).

### Next

We are 2 weeks into learning Django ([our second 100 Days project](https://pybit.es/pages/projects.html)) so it's about time to dedicate a code challenge to it, no? Stay tuned ... starting tomorrow you can get your hands dirty with Django!

By the way there is no deadline to these challenges, you can start any challenge at any time. We can always update our review posts with new PRs.

Follow [our instructions](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and start coding. Have fun!
