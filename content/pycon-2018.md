Going into my first PyCon was pretty daunting. Luckily, the Python community is absolutely incredible so my fears quickly faded. Surprisingly, there was a lot to gain that wasn't actually technical or code related. Read on for a recap of the experience.


##Balancing Talks and Activities

There was an absolute smorgasboard of talks going on during the Conference Days. Unfortunately, there were also Open Sessions to attend and PyBites related duties to fulfill at the same time.

With PyCon, you're going to need to prioritise. Talks are wonderful but they're also available online (check [this year's talks here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX05-2sVSH7Nx3zuk3NYuQ)) so I found that I didn't need to fill my schedule with talk after talk.

Given the talks were online, I ended up participating in more Open Sessions than actual Talks.


##Open Sessions

Open Sessions ROCK. They're small form, themed group sessions where you sit around with other interested parties and discuss the aforementioned theme. Generally the person who created the session will lead the discussion but it ends up being a bit of a free for all. Not in a bad way either! The spirited discussion and knowledge dumped by participants was wonderful.

I attended an awesome session on AR/VR in Python that was run by [Christian Medina](https://twitter.com/tryexceptpass). The discussion was invaluable as participants discussed Unity 3D and the Unreal Engine and how we could possibly interact with them using Python. I also got some great ideas on using OpenCV for non-game related purposes that interest me.

I was also lucky enough to attend a session led by [Trey Hunner](https://twitter.com/treyhunner) on Python Training. There was wonderful conversation on training techniques and the like.

As you can see, the sessions allowed for more varied, open and casual conversation. If you head to PyCon 2019, definitely attend a few of them at least! My recommendation though: don't hog the limelight. Allow and encourage others to speak up and give their opinions and share knowledge.


##Conversation and Networking

There's a lot of networking to be done at a conference like PyCon so it's incredibly important to bring your manners. No one likes rude people!

When you strike up a conversation with another person, again, don't hog the limelight. Ask probing questions to learn more about the other person and what their interest in Python is.

It was in this way that I was able to make a *heap* of new friends and connections as well as even generate some future business opportunities.

I'll even go as far as saying that the connections you make are more important than the talks the conference has on offer.

The key with all of this is to simply **listen**. Make sure you hear the other person and you'll be fine!


##Be Social

One of the greatest ways I was able to connect with other Pythonistas (and our community!) was to get out of the conference and grab lunch/dinner externally. Chatting at a booth or in a hallway at the conference is one thing. Chatting over a beer and some grub is another.

Don't disappear after the conference day has finished. Find the people you've connected with and see if you can go out for a meal. It'll be one of the best things you'll do!


##Bring Water

PyCon makes every effort to keep you hydrated but I definitely found myself searching for a water cooler or bottles of water to no avail. Keep a bottle with you at all times to ensure you don't waste time like I did!


##Meet Contributors

PyCon is your chance to say g'day to the people that have really made a difference in your Python life/journey. I'm happy to report that I was able to meet and shake [Miguel Grinberg's](https://twitter.com/miguelgrinberg) hand. I love his Flask information so meeting him was a big deal!

Just remember, the majority of these contributors are just average people so there's no need to be afraid of saying hi. In fact, saying hi and thanking them for their product/vision etc is one of the best things you can do!



##Conclusion

The key take away from attending PyCon is that it's about the people. The friendly volunteers; the contributors; the friends, you name it. Everyone was so incredibly wonderful that I can't wait to get back there again!

The key to success at the conference is to be nice, open to conversation and always respectful. If you can engage with people effectively then you'll have no issue.

PyCon2018 was amazing. We can't wait to go back in 2019!

Keep Calm and Code in Python.
