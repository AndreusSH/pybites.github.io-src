Title: Code Challenge 14 - Write DRY Code With Decorators

Category: Challenges
Tags: codechallenges, learning, decorators, design patterns, DRY
Slug: codechallenge14
Authors: PyBites
Summary: Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! This week we let you practice with decorators, a nice way to abstract away common functionality. It allows you to alter the behavior of a callable without modifying the callable itself. We agree with Dan Bader that 'understanding decorators is a milestone for any serious Python programmer.' Enjoy!

Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! This week we let you practice with decorators, a nice way to abstract away common functionality. It allows you to alter the behavior of a callable without modifying the callable itself. We agree with Dan Bader that 'understanding decorators is a milestone for any serious Python programmer.' Enjoy!

## What is a decorator?

> Decorators dynamically alter the functionality of a function, method, or class without having to directly use subclasses or change the source code of the function being decorated. ([wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecorators#What_is_a_Decorator))

It's basically a wrapper and it is a [common design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern).

If you are new to this concept we recommend Dan's nice walk-through he published last week: [Python Decorators: A Step-By-Step Introduction](https://dbader.org/blog/python-decorators).

Another great article is RealPython's [Primer on Python Decorators](https://realpython.com/blog/python/primer-on-python-decorators/).

## Roll your own!

In this week's challenge we invite you to come up with useful decorators for yourself or the greater community. We have included [a bit of material](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/master/14/) in our repo to get started. 

Tomorrow we will post an article on how to write decorators that take optional arguments. This caused us some pain, but we got it working. It might be useful to write more flexible decorators. Stay tuned ...

## Getting ready

See [our INSTALL doc](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) how to fork [our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) to get cracking. If you want to share your solution do [a PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/compare) and we will add it to [our community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community) and link to it in our end-of-the-week review.

## Archive

You can find all our code challenges so far [here](http://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html). If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, please [contact us](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) or open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues).

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
