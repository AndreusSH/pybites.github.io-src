Hey Pythonistas,

Blog Code Challenges is back! And with a vengeance ;)

Starting today we will publish a new code challenge every week on Monday. On Friday (or latest the weekend) we will post a review.

Welcome to Pybites Code Challenge 51! In this challenge we get you analysing NBA player data from a CSV file.

You can watch the [video overview here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jeuMMU1a_o).


## The Challenge

If you are reading this on our blog head over to [https://codechalleng.es/challenges/51](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/51).

If you need help getting ready with Github, see our new [instruction video](https://youtu.be/vJsyLSZxqVw).

Now for the challenge: 

- Make a virtual env and install `requests`. No need to install `sqlite3` as it's part of the stdlib.

- Copy the `nba.py` file over to your subdirectory.

- As you can see in the template `nba.py` file, we've given you a headstart by importing the data and parsing the CSV into a list of named tuples.

- *Start coding under the "#CODE HERE" comment and complete the 7 functions we've laid out for you.*

- Note that there are some assert statements under `main` to help you validate your code.

- This challenge is mainly focused on sqlite3, but if you want to use an ORM like sqlalchemy or Pandas that's fine too.
