## Submissions

This was a great challenge. We got to play with OOP and learned a couple of things.

* Julian: exploring inheritance using the character class system in the World of Warcraft, see [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/community/20/hobojoe1848/warlock_class.py).

* Bob: a book/video task planner that sends a weekly SMS (Twilio API) with material to consume, see [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/20/bbelderbos).

* [100DaysOfCode](http://pybit.es/special-100days.html): simple Karma app using inheritance and playing with dunder methods, see [here](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode/blob/master/058/karma.py).

* [Dante](https://github.com/dseptem): Rooms framework (including unittests, nice!), Readme:
