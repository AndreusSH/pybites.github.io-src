Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python programming! Last week we wrote an article on [improving the quality of your code with Better Code Hub](https://pybit.es/bettercodehub.html). This week we let you refactor a Python project. You can choose one of your own or fork a repo of somebody else. Good luck.

## The Challenge

Here are the steps:

* Login with Github to [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com).
* You should see you (public) repos.
* Choose a repo you like to work on or fork another project which after refresh should show up as USER/REPO
* Click the Analyze button. Note you [want to exclude files](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual) that are not relevant for the analysis or might skew its results.
* If you want to PR (Pull Request) your work make a printscreen of the initial score
* Refactor the code to address any issues: 
	* Although the tool checks code coverage, make sure you have enough tests to safely make changes. The code should still work after refactoring!
	* Try to be granular in your commit history so it's easier to see what refactorings you made.
* Take a printscreen of the end result for inclusion in your PR.
	* If you are happy with the result do some bragging and include a Better Code Hub status badge which you can find in the settings of your repository (see also [the FAQ](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/faq)).

## Resources

* BetterCodeHub: [tool](https://bettercodehub.com) | [faq](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/faq) | [config manual]((https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual))
* Read what it is, how it works and a practical example: [Improve the Quality of Your Code with Better Code Hub](https://pybit.es/bettercodehub.html)

## Get credit!

See [our INSTALL doc](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) how to fork [our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) to get cracking.

This doc also provides you with instructions how you can submit your code to our community branch via a Pull Request (PR). We will feature your PRs in our start-of-the-week challenge review ([previous editions](http://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html)).

__But I worked on another repo?__ Indeed. So we suggest to just PR a `README.md` file in your local branch with the before and after screenshots and a short description what you refactored.

### Feedback

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues) or [reach out](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) directly.

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
