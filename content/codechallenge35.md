Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python programming! Last week we wrote an article on [improving the quality of your code with Better Code Hub](https://pybit.es/bettercodehub.html). This week we let you refactor a Python project. 

__You can even win awards thanks to [SIG](https://www.sig.eu) who is sponsoring this challenge!__

## The Challenge

Update: initially we had you pick and improve one of your repos or forks. [SIG](https://www.sig.eu) provided us with a more interesting approach though: [SpringCleaning](https://opensourcespringcleaning.github.io) which template we adopted for this challenge. Check out the instructions below. We will use label *PyBitesChallenge35* and only accept __Python related projects__.

### As a maintainer

* (If not already done) Enable issues in the repository‚Äôs settings page on GitHub.
* Create a 'PyBitesChallenge35' - label [Here‚Äôs how](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-labels-for-issues-and-pull-requests/).
* Create issues based on the proposed prioritized refactoring candidates from [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) and attach the *PyBitesChallenge35* label to them. Here is an example:

	![add the PyBitesChallenge35 label to your GitHub issue]({filename}/images/pcc35-add-label.png)

* To enable Better Code Hub to run on every Push and Pull Request, click the ‚öô &nbsp;&nbsp;icon and toggle the "Push & Pull request analysis" switch. This will activate the webhook.

### As a contributor

* Search on Github for [issues with the *PyBitesChallenge35* label](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3APyBitesChallenge35+)
* Fork, refactor and create a Pull Request.

### Want to see a sample Better Code Hub report?

* Head over to [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com) and login with your GitHub account. You'll then see your repos, and you can start an analysis clicking the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è &nbsp;&nbsp;button. It will analyze the default branch. Or checkout [our article](https://pybit.es/bettercodehub.html).

## What‚Äôs the reward for participation?

If you participate in this initiative you get rewarded with:

* The first 25 contributors that get one Pybites Code Challenge Pull Request accepted will get a free month of Better Code Hub PRO.

* The first 10 contributors that get two Pybites Code Challenge Pull Requests accepted will get a hard copy of [*Building Maintainable Software* (O‚ÄôReilly)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049555.do).

* If you‚Äôre a maintainer, you get a cleaner code base and new contributors to extend your repository. üòä 

## Resources

* BetterCodeHub: [tool](https://bettercodehub.com) | [faq](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/faq) | [config manual](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual)
* Read what it is, how it works and a Python refactoring example: [Improve the Quality of Your Code with Better Code Hub](https://pybit.es/bettercodehub.html)

### Feedback

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues) or [reach out](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) directly.

Our goal is to learn more Python which is way cooler as a community. Good luck and have fun!
