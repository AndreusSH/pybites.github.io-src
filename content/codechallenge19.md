Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! This week we have another nice free-form challenge for you: after last time's [API challenge success](http://pybit.es/codechallenge16.html), we have a part 2 this week where we will let you post to your favorite API. 

##The Challenge

We keep it free-form so you can go wild on consuming your favorite service(s) / data. The difference with last time is that you actually have to edit your account by doing one or more POST requests. Examples:

* Post (periodic) updates to your favorite social media platform. We really like the Twitter API (see [here](http://pybit.es/codechallenge04_review.html), [here](http://pybit.es/100days-autotweet.html), and [here](http://pybit.es/automate-twitter.html)), but you could use Facebook, Linkedin, Pinterest, Instagram, etc.

* Create playlists of your favorite music with the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) / [Soundcloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide) / [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/).

* If you like books, playing with the [Goodreads API last week](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/046), pushing books to your shelve(s) is something this API supports.

* [Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/): send an email, add a calendar invite, add a file to Google drive, to name a few. 

* Push a new article/ post to reddit Python or LearnPython using [their API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api).

* Create a list of your favorite movies with [TheMovieDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en).

* Send SMS with the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/), etc etc ... be creative, scratch your own itch!

Still searching for APIs? Last time we linked to these two resources: [fun APIs to play with (reddit thread)](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3wrswc/what_are_some_fun_apis_to_play_with/) and [programmableweb](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis).
