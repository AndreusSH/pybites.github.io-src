Summary: Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python programming! We love Django (#100DaysOfDjango) and Web APIs. [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) combines the two. "Now is better than never." - let's jump right in and let's use this week's code challenge to build a simple API. In this article some ideas what we can build and links to resources to get started. Have fun and don't forget to share (PR) your work, we can learn a lot from each other. Enjoy!

Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python programming! We love Django (#100DaysOfDjango) and Web APIs. [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) combines the two. "Now is better than never." - let's jump right in and let's use this week's code challenge to build a simple API. In this article some ideas what we can build and links to resources to get started. Have fun and don't forget to share (PR) your work, we can learn a lot from each other. Enjoy!

## The Challenge

Building something is the best way to learn a new technology. We hope you find a longtime need for which DRF is a good fit. If you lack inspiration though here are some ideas:  

* Remember we did the [House Inventory Tracker Challenge](https://pybit.es/codechallenge08.html)? We ended up building a [simple API with Flask](https://pybit.es/simple-flask-api.html) for that one. Maybe you want to give this a spin in DRF?

* Another candidate we found in [our challenge collection](https://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html): [Challenge Estimated Time API](https://pybit.es/codechallenge23.html). Could be another one.

* Some time ago we wrote an article / app: [Simple API Part 2 - Building a Deep Work Logger with Flask, Slack and Google Docs](https://pybit.es/flask-api-part2.html). What if you use this concept with DRF instead of Google Docs?

* Actually the Django app ideas we gave you for [last week's Django challenge](https://pybit.es/codechallenge33.html) could be used to build APIs as well. 

* A TODO list is cliche but could be a useful exercise to get the basics down. [Here](https://medium.com/@ktruong008/building-an-api-with-django-rest-framework-and-class-based-views-75b369b30396) is an article that might be helpful. Or check out [this tutorial](https://michaelwashburnjr.com/building-webapp-tutorial-part-2/).

* Again, if you have better ideas or needs go for it! The goal is to build something using Django REST Framework. Surprise us and the community in your PR submissions :)

### Bonus points:

* Add good test coverage.
* Get authentication right.
* [Deploy your work to Heroku](https://pybit.es/deploy-flask-heroku.html).
* Build a tool the PyBites community can actually use.

## Resources

* [Django REST Framework home](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/):

	> The [quickstart guide](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/) is the fastest way to get up and running, and building APIs with REST framework.

* Real Python has great coverage on the topic:
	* [Django Rest Framework - an Introduction](https://realpython.com/blog/python/django-rest-framework-quick-start/)
	* [Django Rest Framework - Class Based Views](https://realpython.com/blog/python/django-rest-framework-class-based-views/)
	* [Test Driven Development of a Django RESTful API](https://realpython.com/blog/python/test-driven-development-of-a-django-restful-api/)

* Some nice tutorials on Medium:
	* [Modern Django — Part 2: REST APIs, Apps, and Django REST Framework](https://medium.com/@djstein/modern-django-part-2-rest-apis-apps-and-django-rest-framework-ea0cac5ab104)
	* [Building an API with Django REST Framework and Class-Based Views](https://medium.com/@ktruong008/building-an-api-with-django-rest-framework-and-class-based-views-75b369b30396)

* One more tutorial that just came out: [Building a Web App From the Ground Up: Django Rest Framework API Development](https://michaelwashburnjr.com/building-webapp-tutorial-part-3/)

* Extra background: Talk Python had creator Tom Christie recently on: [Episode #125: Django REST framework and a new API star is born](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/125/django-rest-framework-and-a-new-api-star-is-born)
